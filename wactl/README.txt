Send bulk WhatsApp ad messages using Android Debug Bridge (adb).

The wactl utility sends custom WhatsApp messages to your contacts.
Just provide a CSV file with your contacts and a TXT file
with your message template.

You can also send images!

In order to specify the unlock screen PIN you have two options:

 * set the WACTL_PIN environment variable
 * use the -pin=XXX flag each time

If you have a license to unlock all features, create the 
environment variable WACTL_LIC to store the license.

wactl depends on the Android Debug Bridge (adb) tool that is the 
officially provided way of interacting with android devices via
terminal from desktops and laptops.

Refer to the HOWTO.txt file on instructions about how to enable
the Android Developer options on your phone and how to install 
Android Debug Bridge (adb) on your desktop and laptop.

Refer to the DOWNLOAD.txt file for the links to download binaries 
for your OS Arch.

Unlike my other open-source projects, this tool is my effort to 
sustain and reward my work.

Your support motivates me to continue developing and improving this software.

Upon making a donation, please send me an email with your "app key," and I will 
generate and send you a license that unlocks all features.

Thank you for your generosity!
