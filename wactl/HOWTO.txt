Enable Developer options on your phone
======================================

Your phone has several developer options that can be used by 
application developers for testing purposes. These options are 
typically hidden by manufacturers.

Follow these steps to enable the Developer options menu:

1. Go to "Settings" > "System"

2. Touch "About phone"

3. Then tap the "Build number" option seven times to enable Developer Mode.
   You will see a toast message when it is done.

4. Go back to the main "Settings" screen, and you should see a new 
   "Developer" options menu you can access.

5. Go in there and enable the USB debugging option

Now your phone is ready to communicate with your computer.

Installing Android Debug Bridge (adb)
=====================================

WaBot depends on the Android Debug Bridge (adb) tool that is the 
officially provided way of interacting with android devices via
terminal from desktops and laptops.

You can download the Android SDK Platform Tools for your OS here:

   https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools

Extract the contents of this ZIP file into an easily accessible folder.
To access the adb tool from any directory all you need to do is adding
the adb directory to the PATH variable of your operating system.

Below are easier ways to install the tool on different operating systems.
