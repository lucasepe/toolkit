# toolkit

This repository contains various command-line tools to help you automate different tasks. 

Unlike my other [Open Source projects](https://github.com/lucasepe?tab=repositories), these are available for free in trial mode. You can try them out, see 
if they meet your needs, and with a small donation (each under ten euros), you'll receive a code to unlock all features.
